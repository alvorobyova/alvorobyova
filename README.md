**I have been interested in development for more than a year.**
I began my 'diving' into IT area by taking various free courses and intensive courses to get a feel out the frontend-developer profession.<br>
I was 100% convinced that I wanted to connect my life with development. 
<blockquote>Working in IT can be very challenging, but at the same time interesting and exciting!</blockquote>

At the moment I've successfully graduated online-school 'ITLogia'.

While studying I completed a wide variety of projects: landing pages using Flexbox/Grid, various libraries and plugins, and SPA in pure JavaScript with numerous http requests. The latest projects are implemented in Angular (TypeScript).
